awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) a[i]=(a[i]?a[i] FS $i:$i)} END {for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) print a[i]}' file.txt

This command concatenates words from all lines into one line, separating them with spaces, and then prints each word on a separate line.

NF represents the number of fields in the current line, FS is the field separator (by default it is space).

a[i] is an array used to accumulate words from each line.

The END block executes after processing all lines of the file, where each word from the array a is printed on a separate line.
